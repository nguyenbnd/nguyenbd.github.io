The Maze Solver Robot project involved creating an autonomous robot designed to navigate and solve intricate mazes. The robot uses a combination of sensors and algorithms to map out the maze, find the shortest path, and adapt to complex obstacles.

Key aspects of the project included:
- **Design and Assembly:** Constructed the robot with precision components to ensure stability and functionality.
- **Sensor Integration:** Implemented sensors for maze detection and navigation, including infrared and ultrasonic sensors.
- **Pathfinding Algorithms:** Developed and integrated algorithms such as A* and Dijkstra's for efficient maze-solving.
- **Motor Control:** Programmed motor control using PID controllers to enhance movement accuracy and speed.

Our robot successfully completed various challenging mazes and demonstrated high efficiency in finding optimal paths.

Below is a sample code used for sensor data acquisition:

```cpp
int readSensor(int pin)
{
    int sensorValue = analogRead(pin);
    return sensorValue;
}
