Pong Game is a classic arcade game that I implemented as an individual project in 2015. This project allowed me to dive into game development and enhance my JavaScript skills.

The game is built using plain JavaScript, which handles the game logic, rendering, and user input. The project was a great way to understand fundamental game mechanics and the basics of real-time user interaction.

Here is some example code to illustrate how the game logic is implemented:
